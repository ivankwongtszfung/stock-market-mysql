Since I have two tables store the stock value, one is stock which has an index number as a primary key and the stock_log which has a timestamp as a primary key. When customer do searching, it searches the delay information from stock_log, if they are customer broker administrators, then list the latest stock information. I assume for every 15mins, the stock value will be only update once and the stock_log is triggered by stock update or insert

To attach the 3NF structure every many to many relationship I will additionally add a look up table to store the value. However, I also find there is some redundancy in the problem in 3NF so I add tables when there is one to many relationships to abort useless relation
Since one cell should have one value, so the limited order I use two columns to store, upper and lower.
